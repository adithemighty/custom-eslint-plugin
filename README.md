# Example custom eslint plugin

This is an example for a custom eslint plugin that checks whether the correct value is used in an object.

## Installation

Check out the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

If you now go to the `index.js` file in the `src` directory VSCode will show you some squiggly lines (provided you have the ESLint extension).

## Running the tests

To execute the tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```
